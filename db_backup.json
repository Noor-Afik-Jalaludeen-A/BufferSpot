They are essential tools for solving problems effectively and are widely used in software development, competitive programming, and technical interviews.\r\n\r\nA data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common types of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs. Each of these structures is designed for specific kinds of operations and use cases. For example, arrays provide fast access through indexing, linked lists are useful for dynamic memory allocation, and trees are commonly used for hierarchical data.\r\n\r\nAlgorithms are step-by-step instructions or procedures used to perform tasks or solve problems. In the context of data structures, algorithms define how to insert, delete, search, or traverse data stored within a structure. Examples of important algorithms include searching algorithms like binary search, sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort, and traversal algorithms used in trees and graphs.\r\n\r\nThe importance of DSA lies in its ability to optimize the performance of software. Writing code that works is only one part of programming. Writing code that works efficiently under various constraints is what separates a good developer from a great one. For instance, when handling large datasets or real-time applications, using an inefficient algorithm or structure can lead to noticeable delays and poor user experience.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the time and space complexity of algorithms, often expressed using Big O notation, is crucial in evaluating how scalable a solution is. Time complexity refers to how the running time of an algorithm grows with input size, while space complexity measures the amount of memory used.\r\n\r\nLearning DSA helps improve logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deeper understanding of how software really works under the hood. It also prepares you for technical interviews, where DSA problems are a key focus.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Data Structures and Algorithms are more than just academic concepts. They are practical tools that empower developers to write faster, more reliable, and scalable code. Whether you're building applications, preparing for interviews, or solving real-world problems, a solid grasp of DSA is a valuable asset in your programming journey.", "date_posted": "2025-06-24T13:08:24.473Z", "author": 1, "views": 1}}, {"model": "Blog.post", "pk": 13, "fields": {"title": "Understanding Linear Data Structures", "content": "Linear data structures are among the most essential building blocks in computer science. They organize data in a sequential manner, where each element is connected to its previous and next element, making them easy to implement and traverse. This article explores major types of linear data structures, their uses in real-world applications, and study references for deeper understanding.\r\n\r\nArrays\r\n\r\nAn array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element can be accessed directly using an index. Arrays are one of the simplest and most widely used data structures. They are best suited when the number of elements is known in advance and random access is needed.\r\n\r\nReal-world example - Storing monthly temperatures, managing leaderboards, or organizing students' test scores in a class.\r\n\r\nStudy link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-c-cpp/\r\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-c-cpp/\r\n\r\nLinked Lists\r\n\r\nA linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a node, containing the data and a pointer to the next node. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory, allowing dynamic memory allocation. There are different types of linked lists including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.\r\n\r\nReal-world example - Implementing music playlists where songs are connected sequentially, navigating through web pages with forward and back buttons, or managing undo-redo operations in software.\r\n\r\nStudy link - https://www.programiz.com/dsa/linked-list\r\nhttps://www.programiz.com/dsa/linked-list\r\n\r\nStacks\r\n\r\nA stack follows the Last In First Out principle. It allows insertion and deletion only at one end, called the top. This property makes stacks very useful in applications where the most recent item added should be processed first.\r\n\r\nReal-world example - Backtracking in games, parsing expressions in compilers, and managing function calls in recursion.\r\n\r\nStudy link - [\r\nhttps://www.javatpoint.com/data-structure-stack\r\nhttps://www.javatpoint.com/data-structure-stack\r\n\r\nQueues\r\n\r\nA queue follows the First In First Out principle. It allows elements to be added at the rear and removed from the front. Queues are essential for handling tasks in the order they arrive.\r\n\r\nReal-world example - Call center systems, printer job scheduling, and order processing in online shopping.\r\n\r\nStudy link - https://www.scaler.com/topics/data-structures/queue-in-data-structure/\r\nhttps://www.scaler.com/topics/data-structures/queue-in-data-structure/\r\n\r\nDeques\r\n\r\nA deque, or double-ended queue, allows insertion and deletion from both front and rear ends. It combines the properties of stacks and queues. Deques can be used when elements need to be processed in both directions.\r\n\r\nReal-world example - Implementing browser history navigation, designing sliding window algorithms, or maintaining a list of recent items accessed in software.\r\n\r\nStudy link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deque-set-1-introduction-applications/\r\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deque-set-1-introduction-applications/\r\n\r\nLinear data structures are fundamental not only in programming problems but also in developing efficient and reliable systems.

Instead, they are structured in a hierarchical or interconnected way, allowing for complex relationships between elements. Unlike linear structures such as arrays, stacks, and queues, where data is organized in a straight line, non-linear structures provide greater flexibility and efficiency when dealing with intricate datasets and operations that involve relationships beyond simple sequences.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nThe main characteristic of non-linear data structures is their ability to represent multiple relationships between data elements. In these structures, one element can be connected to many others, forming a web-like structure. This allows for efficient searching, hierarchical storage, and management of large and complex data models.\r\n\r\nNon-linear data structures are particularly useful in scenarios where data must be represented in a nested or branched format, such as file systems, databases, networks, and decision-making processes. The two primary types of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.\r\n\r\nTypes of Non-linear Data Structures\r\n\r\nTrees\r\n\r\nA tree is a non-linear data structure that represents data in a hierarchical form. It consists of nodes connected by edges. The topmost node is called the root, and each node may have zero or more child nodes. Trees are widely used in various applications due to their hierarchical structure.\r\n\r\nContent about Trees\r\n\r\nTrees follow a parent-child relationship where each child has exactly one parent, except the root which has no parent. The structure starts from the root and expands downward. Nodes with no children are called leaves. Common types of trees include binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees.\r\n\r\nBinary trees have at most two children per node. Binary search trees maintain the property where the left child is less than the parent, and the right child is greater, facilitating efficient search operations. AVL trees and red-black trees are self-balancing binary trees that maintain balance to ensure logarithmic time operations. B-trees are generalized multi-way trees used in databases and file systems to manage large blocks of data.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nOrganizing hierarchical menu structures in applications, representing a file system with folders and files, storing parsed syntax trees in compilers, and managing hierarchical data in databases.\r\n\r\nReal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* File systems where directories contain subdirectories and files\r\n* Autocomplete functionality where suggestions are structured in a trie (a specialized tree)\r\n* Decision trees used in machine learning for classification tasks\r\n\r\nStudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/)\r\n-> [https://www.programiz.com/dsa/trees](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/trees)\r\n\r\nGraphs\r\n\r\nA graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a finite set of nodes, also called vertices, connected by edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected and may contain cycles. They are widely used to represent networks of related data.\r\n\r\nContent about Graphs\r\n\r\nGraphs are incredibly versatile and can represent a variety of real-world structures. In a graph, nodes represent entities, and edges represent connections between them. Directed graphs have edges with a direction, indicating a one-way relationship, while undirected graphs have bidirectional edges.\r\n\r\nGraphs can also be weighted or unweighted. In weighted graphs, each edge carries a weight, often used to represent costs, distances, or capacities. Graphs can be represented using adjacency matrices or adjacency lists, with each representation serving different use cases based on memory and performance considerations.\r\n\r\nGraph traversal algorithms such as Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) are essential for exploring nodes and their relationships. Advanced algorithms like Dijkstra’s for shortest paths, Kruskal’s and Prim’s for minimum spanning trees, and Floyd-Warshall for all pairs shortest paths extend the utility of graphs.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nModeling social networks where users are connected through friendships or follow relationships, mapping GPS navigation systems, or representing dependencies in software builds.\r\n\r\nReal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* Social media platforms where each user is a node and friendships are edges\r\n* Web page link structures, where pages are nodes and hyperlinks are directed edges\r\n* Airline route maps where airports are nodes and flights are edges with distances as weights\r\n\r\nStudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/)\r\n-> [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data\\_structures\\_algorithms/graph\\_data\\_structure.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/graph_data_structure.htm)\r\n\r\nHeaps\r\n\r\nA heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, each parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes. In a min heap, each parent is less than or equal to its children. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues.\r\n\r\nContent about Heaps\r\n\r\nHeaps are complete binary trees, which means all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right. This structure allows heaps to be efficiently implemented using arrays.\r\n\r\nMax heaps are used when the highest priority element should be accessed first, while min heaps prioritize the lowest element. Heaps are especially useful for heap sort and for managing resources with priorities.\r\n\r\nHeap operations include insertion, deletion, and heapify. The time complexity for these operations is logarithmic, making heaps a very efficient structure for priority management.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nManaging a to-do list where each task has a priority, or dynamically retrieving the top k elements in a data stream.\r\n\r\nReal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* Priority scheduling in operating systems\r\n* Dynamic median finding in streaming data\r\n* Event-driven simulation systems\r\n\r\nStudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-data-structure/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-data-structure/)\r\n-> [https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-data-structure](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-data-structure)\r\n\r\nTries\r\n\r\nA trie, or prefix tree, is a specialized tree used for storing associative data structures. It is particularly useful for storing strings and performing quick lookup operations.\r\n\r\nContent about Tries\r\n\r\nEach node in a trie represents a character, and paths from the root to the leaves represent words. Tries allow for efficient storage and retrieval of strings, particularly when dealing with a large set of keys that share common prefixes.\r\n\r\nTries are used in dictionary implementations, auto-completion, and spell checking. The space complexity of tries can be high but is often optimized through techniques like path compression or using ternary search trees.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nImplementing an autocomplete feature in a search engine or managing a dynamic dictionary.\r\n\r\nReal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* Contact list searching on mobile devices\r\n* Auto-suggest functionality in search engines\r\n* Implementing IP routing where each node corresponds to a bit in an IP address\r\n\r\nStudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/)\r\n-> [https://www.programiz.com/dsa/trie](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/trie)\r\n\r\nHash Tables\r\n\r\nA hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Though typically implemented in arrays, hash tables are considered non-linear due to the non-sequential nature of their data access patterns.\r\n\r\nContent about Hash Tables\r\n\r\nHash tables use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. They provide constant time average-case complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.\r\n\r\nTo handle collisions, techniques like chaining (storing multiple elements in the same bucket) or open addressing (finding another spot in the array) are used. Hash tables are highly efficient and widely used in practice.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nImplementing a symbol table in compilers, caching data, or managing unique elements.\r\n\r\nReal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* Storing and retrieving password hashes\r\n* Implementing dictionaries or maps in programming languages\r\n* Caching frequently accessed data like DNS results\r\n\r\nStudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-data-structure/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-data-structure/)\r\n-> [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data\\_structures\\_algorithms/hash\\_data\\_structure.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/hash_data_structure.htm)\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nNon-linear data structures offer flexible and powerful ways to manage complex data relationships. Trees, graphs, heaps, tries, and hash tables each serve distinct purposes and are applied in various domains of software and systems engineering. Understanding these structures and their applications is essential for designing efficient algorithms and systems that can handle real-world challenges involving large and interconnected datasets.", "date_posted": "2025-06-24T20:08:09.174Z", "author": 1, "views": 2}}, {"model": "Blog.post", "pk": 15, "fields": {"title": "Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS)", "content": "Overview\r\n\r\nObject-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to represent data and methods. These objects can contain both data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). OOPS focuses on enhancing modularity, reusability, scalability, and maintainability by organizing software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. It is widely used in many programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, and Ruby.\r\n\r\nTypes of OOPS Concepts\r\n\r\n1. Class\r\n\r\nA class serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior (data and methods) that the created objects will have. A class does not occupy memory until it is instantiated.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nConsider a blueprint of a house. The blueprint defines the layout, rooms, and facilities but is not an actual house. You need to use the blueprint to build a real house. Similarly, a class defines the structure and behavior for creating objects.\r\n\r\nReal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* A class named \"Car\" with attributes like brand, color, and speed, and methods like drive() and brake().\r\n* A class named \"Employee\" that contains attributes like name, ID, and salary, and methods like calculateSalary().\r\n\r\nStudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-objects-python/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-objects-python/)\r\n-> [https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/class-object](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/class-object)\r\n\r\n2. Object\r\n\r\nAn object is an instance of a class. It contains actual values for the properties defined in the class. Objects interact with one another through methods and can be created multiple times from the same class.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nIf a class is a blueprint, an object is a real house built from that blueprint. You can build multiple houses from the same blueprint.\r\n\r\nReal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* A specific car like \"Red Tesla Model S\" is an object of the class \"Car\".\r\n* An employee named \"John\" with employee ID 123 is an object of the class \"Employee\".\r\n\r\nStudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.w3schools.com/java/java\\_oop.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp)\r\n-> [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python\\_classes\\_objects.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm)\r\n\r\n3. Inheritance\r\n\r\nInheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits the properties and behavior of an existing class. The existing class is called the parent or base class, and the new class is called the child or derived class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between different classes.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nA child inherits physical traits from their parents. In programming, a \"Dog\" class can inherit attributes and behaviors from a \"Animal\" class.\r\n\r\nReal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* A \"Manager\" class inheriting from an \"Employee\" class.\r\n* A \"SavingsAccount\" class inheriting from a \"BankAccount\" class.\r\n\r\nStudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-java/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-java/)\r\n-> [https://realpython.com/python-inheritance/](https://realpython.com/python-inheritance/)\r\n\r\n4. Polymorphism\r\n\r\nPolymorphism allows methods to perform differently based on the object that is calling them. There are two types: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding). It enables a single interface to be used for different underlying data types.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nThe word \"run\" can have different meanings based on context: you can run a race, run a business, or run a program. Similarly, polymorphism allows functions or methods to adapt their behavior.\r\n\r\nReal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* The method \"draw()\" behaving differently for \"Circle\", \"Square\", and \"Triangle\" classes.\r\n* An overridden method \"makeSound()\" producing different sounds in subclasses \"Dog\" and \"Cat\".\r\n\r\nStudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.javatpoint.com/runtime-polymorphism-in-java](https://www.javatpoint.com/runtime-polymorphism-in-java)\r\n-> [https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/polymorphism](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/polymorphism)\r\n\r\n5. Encapsulation\r\n\r\nEncapsulation is the process of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) into a single unit, called a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and can prevent the accidental modification of data.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nThink of a capsule: it contains medicine inside and protects the content from external interference. Similarly, encapsulation protects the internal data of a class.\r\n\r\nReal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* Banking systems hiding user credentials and exposing only essential methods.\r\n* A software class that controls access to sensitive customer data using private variables and public getter and setter methods.\r\n\r\nStudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encapsulation-in-java/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encapsulation-in-java/)\r\n-> [https://www.w3schools.com/java/java\\_encapsulation.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_encapsulation.asp)\r\n\r\n6. Abstraction\r\n\r\nAbstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It simplifies software design by separating the what from the how.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nWhen you use a smartphone, you interact with a user-friendly interface, not the complex code inside. Abstraction does the same by exposing only necessary parts of the code.\r\n\r\nReal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* A car's dashboard shows speed and fuel but hides the working of the engine.\r\n* ATM machines showing options like withdraw, deposit, and check balance without exposing backend processes.\r\n\r\nStudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java\\_abstraction.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_abstraction.htm)\r\n-> [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-abstraction](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-abstraction)\r\n\r\nObject-Oriented Programming provides a clear structure for software development, enhances code reusability through inheritance, and allows for more secure and flexible applications.

It facilitates the processes of defining, creating, updating, and administering databases. DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update, and manage data.\r\n\r\nA DBMS ensures that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible. It serves as an interface between the database and end-users or application programs, ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible.\r\n\r\ntypes of DBMS\r\n\r\n1. Hierarchical DBMS\r\n   Hierarchical DBMS organizes data in a tree-like structure. Data is stored in records, which are connected to one another through links. Each child record has only one parent, which resembles a tree hierarchy. This model is efficient for handling large volumes of data and establishing relationships where a one-to-many hierarchy exists.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\nOrganizational structures, where an employee reports to one manager, or file systems that organize folders and files in a nested format.\r\n\r\nreal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* Windows file system\r\n* IBM Information Management System (IMS)\r\n\r\nstudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hierarchical-database-model/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hierarchical-database-model/)\r\n-> [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/dbms\\_data\\_models.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/dbms_data_models.htm)\r\n\r\n2. Network DBMS\r\n   Network DBMS uses a graph structure to represent and manage relationships between data. Unlike the hierarchical model, the network model allows each child to have multiple parents. This flexibility allows for more complex relationships.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\nA college database where a student can enroll in multiple courses and each course can have multiple students.\r\n\r\nreal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* Integrated Data Store (IDS)\r\n* TurboIMAGE by Hewlett-Packard\r\n\r\nstudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.studytonight.com/dbms/network-model-in-dbms](https://www.studytonight.com/dbms/network-model-in-dbms)\r\n-> [https://www.javatpoint.com/dbms-network-model](https://www.javatpoint.com/dbms-network-model)\r\n\r\n3. Relational DBMS (RDBMS)\r\n   Relational DBMS stores data in the form of tables (relations). Each table consists of rows and columns where each row is a unique record and each column holds data attributes. It supports Structured Query Language (SQL) for accessing and managing data.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\nManaging user accounts in a website where each table holds user information, roles, and permissions.\r\n\r\nreal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* MySQL\r\n* PostgreSQL\r\n* Oracle Database\r\n* Microsoft SQL Server\r\n\r\nstudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-dbms-relational-model/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-dbms-relational-model/)\r\n-> [https://www.w3schools.com/sql/](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)\r\n\r\n4. Object-oriented DBMS (OODBMS)\r\n   Object-oriented DBMS integrates object-oriented programming principles with database technology. Data is stored in objects, similar to objects in OOP languages. Each object contains data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of methods.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\nStoring multimedia, CAD designs, or software component libraries where each item has associated behaviors and data.\r\n\r\nreal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* db4o\r\n* ObjectDB\r\n* Gemstone\r\n\r\nstudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/dbms\\_object\\_oriented\\_data\\_model.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/dbms_object_oriented_data_model.htm)\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-database-model/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-database-model/)\r\n\r\n5. Document-oriented DBMS\r\n   Document-oriented DBMS is a type of NoSQL database that stores data as documents, often in JSON or BSON formats. It is schema-less and is suitable for semi-structured data. It enables flexible and scalable data storage.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\nBlogging platforms where each blog post may have different tags, content structure, and metadata.\r\n\r\nreal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* MongoDB\r\n* CouchDB\r\n\r\nstudy links:\r\n-> [https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-document-oriented-database/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-document-oriented-database/)\r\n\r\n6. Columnar DBMS\r\n   Columnar DBMS stores data tables by column rather than by row. This model is especially efficient for analytics and big data applications where operations on large data volumes require high performance.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\nData warehouses that need to perform complex aggregations on massive datasets.\r\n\r\nreal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* Apache Cassandra\r\n* Amazon Redshift\r\n* Google Bigtable\r\n\r\nstudy links:\r\n-> [https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/columnar/](https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/columnar/)\r\n-> [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-are-column-oriented-nosql-databases](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-are-column-oriented-nosql-databases)\r\n\r\n7. Graph DBMS\r\n   Graph DBMS uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. It is particularly useful for data where relationships are key.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\nSocial media platforms where users follow each other and share content with connections.\r\n\r\nreal-world examples:\r\n\r\n* Neo4j\r\n* ArangoDB\r\n* Amazon Neptune\r\n\r\nstudy links:\r\n-> [https://neo4j.com/graph-databases/](https://neo4j.com/graph-databases/)\r\n-> [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-graph-databases/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-graph-databases/)\r\n\r\nUnderstanding different types of DBMS helps in selecting the right database solution for specific application needs.
